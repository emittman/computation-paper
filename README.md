# chapter1Template

This repository is both a standalone paper as well as a thesis chapter. 
The main document is `chapter1.tex` that includes relevant content
for the paper and the thesis.
The document `paper1.tex` is a wrapper for `chapter1.tex` that creates the 
stand-alone paper. 
Both files may include additional tex files, 
but these tex files should be placed in the main directory for ease converting
the paper to a version suitable for submission on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

This repository may also contain subdirectories for code, figures, and tables.
The figure directory will likely need to be included in the `\graphicspath` in
the thesis.
